This car belonged to my wife thoughout high-school in the 80's, (It still has
 HS [[file:parking_sticker.jpg][Parking Sticker]]) When she went to college it was given to a family friend
who put it in their garage and forgot about it.  30 years later, they reached
out,and gave it back to us. We've done pretty much the same for the last ten
years as well, but we have made enough repairs to get it up and running around
the town.

The original color was fire engine red, but it's been painted at least twice
since then.  In some of the pictures, it looks patinaed, but really it's more of
a copper color paint that hasn't been renewed.

We don't have any real skills in refurbishing cars, so we pretty much tried to follow
the hypocratic oath of "First, do no harm".  Most of the repairs we did work on
were to get the car able to run around our little town.

Here is a list of the items we worked on.

*** Electrical
**** New Wiring
**** Tail lights

*** Body
**** New Ragtop
**** Interior Placeholders
**** Re-attached Driver's seat

** Informational

The 1948 Jeepster, known internally as the VJ-2) and as the VJ-673 in the
mechanic's manual.  Our jeepster has the original 4 cylinder "Go-Devil" L-134
engine.  Ours has no oil filter, which was optional.

When we took ownership, it didn't have a title, but we had enough proof of
ownership that we received a provisional title, which is now valid.
