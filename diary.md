Connal and I pulled out the gas tank.  There is a bit of scum in the bottom of the tank, which I think was floating on the surface of the gas.  Otherwise looks very clean.  I'm thinking of ways to get a better view of the whole thing.  Maybe a camera scope ($250 :).

We cleaned up the outside, looks very nice.  We also removed the hood, and cleaned a bit of the front engine.  Despite the info we received in Nikki's cache, it looks like we have an original Willys Jeep engine. 

The distributor cap, and all the wires are brand new. I bet the plugs will be as well, though they show considerably more rust.

Also cleaned the back a bit.  There is quite a bit of rust in the interior of the car.  Need a plan for that.

We started some molasses soaks as a test.

I'm thinking that we can use birch plywood panels in the interior of the car.  sand blasted aluminum is another idea.

First day of working on the Jeepster renovation.  My goal is just to get the old fluids, and junk to the hazardous waste site over the weekend.

First, I drained the gas.  There still was about 3 gallons in the tank.  It came out a beautiful red color, and wasn't too sedimenty until the very end.  Have see a few differenet methods of cleaning the tank.  Will remove it once I figure out the locked gas cap

Next drained about 4 qts of blueish oil from the engine, and then about 3 quarts of normal looking radiator fluid.  Still need to look at the brakes, and remove the oil filter, gas filter, spark plugs.
