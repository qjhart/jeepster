# Jeepster

The 1948 Jeepster, known internally as the VJ-2) and as the VJ-673 in the mechanic's manual.  
Our jeepster has the original 4 cylinder "Go-Devil" L-134 engine.  Ours has no oil filter, which was optional.


Our serial number is 77220 (I think). The serial number plate is in pretty bad shape. It was found behind the glove box however.
